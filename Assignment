# Assignment

Add your name to one of the rows in this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jYOx_BCUWnR7IhMTmw4oaymGovGxao5-P4RBRpjKdDA/edit#gid=356692471). The genes marked in the row next to your name are the ones you need to analyse for the assignment.


**Assignment** You need to make a concatenated dataset of the 4 genes that have been assigned to you, along with a gene partition file (as you did in [Tutorial 2](../Alignments)), and then analyse this dataset in IQ-TREE (as you did in [Tutorial 5](../ModelSelection) and [Tutorial 4](../MaximumLikelihood)).

Make a short report including the resulting tree. Your tree should have branch support shown. In your report also answer the following two questions.

1) Are there any differences between the tree based on these five genes compared to the tree you inferred in Tutorial 5? 

2) Are there any differences between the tree based on these five genes compared to the ASTRAL tree?

If there are differences in topology, illustrate them in the trees using FigTree as described in Tutorial 7, include all of the relevant trees in your report, and in one short paragraph describe these differences.

If you have any questions about the assignment, feel free to email us.

The report is due on Friday, May 2 by midnight.
